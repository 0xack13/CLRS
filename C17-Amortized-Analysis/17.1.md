### Exercise 17.1-1
***
If the set of stack operations included a MULTIPUSH operation, which pushes k items onto the stack, would the O(1) bound on the amortized cost of stack operations continue to hold?

### `Answer`
MULTIPUSH has k PUSHes, which means that the stack can only do k POPs. So yes, the bound still holds.


### Exercise 17.1-2
***
Show that if a DECREMENT operation were included in the k-bit counter example, n operations could cost as much as theta(nk) time.

### `Answer`
In the worst case, going from 1[k-1 0's] (ie. 1000 -> 0111) takes k flips. Could do any sequence of increment and decrement from 1000 -> 0111 -> 1000 -> 0111 (n times), which is theta(nk).
