### Exercises 3.1-1
***
Let f(n) and g(n) be asymptotically nonnegative functions. Using the basic definition of Θ-notation, prove that max(f(n), g(n)) = Θ(f(n) + g(n)).

### `Answer`
我们需要证明 c1(f(n) + g(n)) <= max(f(n), g(n)) <= c2(f(n) + g(n)) <br \>
因为f和g都是非负函数，只需要令c1 = 0.5, c2 = 1即可.


### Exercises 3.1-2
***
Show that for any real constants a and b, where b > 0,

![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\(n+a\)^b = \\Theta\(n^b\))

### `Answer`
![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\(n+a\)^b = n^b + C_1n^{b-1} + C_2n^{b-2} + ...)

当n很大时,第一项起主导作用.


### Exercises 3.1-3
***
Explain why the statement, "The running time of algorithm A is at least O(n^2)," is meaningless.

### `Answer`
O-notation确定的是一个上界，而at least确定的是一个下界

### Exercises 3.1-4
***
Is ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex? 2^{n+1} = O\(2^n\)?) Is![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex? 2^{2n} = O\(2^n\)?)

### `Answer`
前者成立，后者不成立

### Exercises 3.1-5
***
Prove Theorem 3.1. *For any two functions f(n) and g(n), we have f(n) = Θ(g(n)) if and only if f(n) = O(g(n)) andf(n) = Ω(g(n)).*

### `Answer`
显而易见

### Exercises 3.1-6
***
Prove that the running time of an algorithm is Θ(g(n)) if and only if its worst-case runningtime is O(g(n)) and its best-case running time is Ω(g(n)).

### `Answer`
Theorem 3.1.

### Exercises 3.1-7
***
Prove that o(g(n)) ∩ ω(g(n)) is the empty set.

### `Answer`
显而易见

### Exercises 3.1-8
***
We can extend our notation to the case of two parameters n and m that can go to infinity independently at different rates. For a given function g(n, m), we denote by O(g(n, m)) the set of functions
O(g(n, m)) = {f(n, m): there exist positive constants c, n0, and m0 such that 0 ≤ f(n, m) ≤ cg(n, m)for all n≥n0 and m≥m0}.
Give corresponding definitions for Ω(g(n, m)) and Θ(g(n, m)).

### `Answer`
Ω(g(n,m)={f(n,m):there exist positive constants c,n0, and m0 such that 0 ≤ cg(n,m) ≤ f(n,m) for all n≥n0 and m≥m0.

Θ(g(n,m)={f(n,m):there exist positive constants c1,c2,n0, and m0 such that 0 ≤ c1g(n,m) ≤ f(n,m) ≤ c2g(n,m) for all n≥n0 and m≥m0.
