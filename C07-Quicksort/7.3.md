### Exercises 7.3-1
***
Why do we analyze the average-case performance of a randomized algorithm and not its worst-case performance?

### `Answer`
因为最坏情况很极端才会发生，我们想要的是期望时间.


### Exercises 7.3-2
***
During the running of the procedure RANDOMIZED-QUICKSORT, how many calls are made to the random-number generator RANDOM in the worst case? How about in the best case? Give your answer in terms of Θ-notation.

### `Answer`
最好情况:

T(n) = 2T(n-1) + 1 = Θ(n)

最坏情况:

T(n) = T(n-1) + 1 = Θ(n)
