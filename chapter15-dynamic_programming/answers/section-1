15.1-1:
	It's very easy.see my Assembly-line-sche.c.

15.1-2:
	This is a geometric progression

15.1-3:
	It's very easy too.just add 2 geometric progression,wo get the sum.

15.1-4:
	It's simple.when we calculate f(n),we just need f(n-1).so we just alloc f1[2]andf2[2].
	
15.1-5:
	if l1[j] = 2,then f1[j-1]>f2[j-1]+t(2,j-1) ------	@1
	if l2[j] = 1,then f2[j-1]>f1[j-1]+t(1,j-1) ------	@2
	we add @1 and @2,find that t(1,j-1)+t(2,j-1) < 0  wrong !!!!!!
