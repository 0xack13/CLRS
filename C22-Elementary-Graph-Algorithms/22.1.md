***
The **transpose** of a directed graph G = (V, E) is the graph G**T** = (V, E**T**), where E**T** = {(v, u) in V × V : (u, v) in E}. Thus, G**T** is G with all its edges reversed. Describe efficient algorithms for computing G**T** from G, for both the adjacency-list and adjacency-matrix representations of G. Analyze the running times of your algorithms.

**T** means transpose

### `Answer`

* adjacency-list : 遍历所有的节点,对某个节点i,遍历其Adj,将i这个节点增加到Adj中遇到的每个点的Adj中. 需要的时间是O(V+E)

* adjacency-matrix : 只需要将矩阵转置,需要的时间是O(V*V)

Given an adjacency-list representation of a multigraph G = (V, E), describe an O(V + E)-time algorithm to compute the adjacency-list representation of the "equivalent" undirected graph G′ = (V, E′), where E′ consists of the edges in E with all multiple edges between two vertices replaced by a single edge and with all self-loops removed.

### `Answer`
遍历某一个节点的边时,用set来判断是否重复边即可. self-loop很容易判断.

### Exercises 22.1-6
***
When an adjacency-matrix representation is used, most graph algorithms require time Ω(V2), but there are some exceptions. Show that determining whether a directed graph G contains a **universal sink**-a vertex with in-degree |V| - 1 and out-degree 0-can be determined in time O(V), given an adjacency matrix for G.

### `Answer`

从Matrix[1,1]开始,如果当前位置是0,则往右走一步;如果是1,则往下走一步;一直走到最后一行或者最后一列再停下.再检查该位置是否满足**universal sink**的定义.

***Suppose that instead of a linked list, each array entry Adj[u] is a hash table containing the vertices v for which (u, v) in E. If all edge lookups are equally likely, what is the expected time to determine whether an edge is in the graph? What disadvantages does this scheme have? Suggest an alternate data structure for each edge list that solves these problems. Does your alternative have disadvantages compared to the hash table?### `Answer`
[reference](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9667571/graph-what-are-the-disadvantages-if-i-replace-each-linked-list-in-adjacency-li)

I think the expected time is O(1), because I just go Hashtable t = Adj[u], then return t.get(v);

I think the disadvantage is that Hashtable will take more spaces then linked list.


It could be a binary search tree.

In an adjacency matrix, each vertex is followed by an array of V elements. This O(V)-space cost leads to fast (O(1)-time) searching of edges.

In an adjacency list, each vertex is followed by a list, which contains only the n adjacent vertices. This space-efficient way leads to slow searching (O(n)).

A hash table is a compromise between the array and the list. It uses less space than V, but requires the handle of collisions in searching.

A binary search tree is another compromise -- the space cost is minimum as that of lists, and the time cost in searching is O(lg n).
